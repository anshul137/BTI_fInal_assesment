                    Responsive design is the GUI (graphic user interface). We use this approach
                    to create content which we can adjust to any screen size of the user. It is 
                    the browser reacting to the user’s device through media query that is CSS 
                    (Cascading Style Sheets). It detects the device and then serving up the 
                    friendly version of the resolution for that particular device such as 
                    standard desktop, mobile and mobile tablets. During my research I found that 
                    there are three main principles of responsive design. First, Fluid grid 
                    system which uses the relative measure and respond to the width of the 
                    viewport. Second, Fluid Image in which we shrink the size of the image that 
                    are on the web page according to the size of the users display screen. 
                    Lastly are the media queries which are the filter that we use so that we can 
                    detect the browsing device dimensions and make our design match with the user’s 
                    device screen size. Moreover, with the responsive design we can also hide certain
                    items for example background images or the secondary content that is available on the 
                    page. Hiding content from the user depends upon the practical knowledge about the user 
                    and on which device he will be going to access the website. <br>

                    The main potential advantage of responsive design is that we don’t need to 
                    develop different websites for the different device type. We prioritize the
                    content of the website so that it becomes easier for the user so that they 
                    can find what they are looking for easily. <br>

                    I have learned a lot from this course this was my first experience to 
                    actually create my own website and publish it. During this course I have
                    completed many web client programming tasks for different browsers. I have
                    learned how to use the java script language types, syntax, regular 
                    expression how we declare and use the function, scope, object and how to use 
                    the inheritance to complete the programming task. Moreover, I have learned 
                    about DOM (document object model) in which we have used document structure, 
                    hypertext and document modification to the content for the users. In this 
                    course I have learned about the CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) how we can use 
                    the CSS to embed the design, style and format into our website. Through all 
                    the assignment and test, I have practice enough that now I know 
                    how to create my simple website with some designing.
